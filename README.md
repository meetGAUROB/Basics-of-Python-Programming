# Codestorm Project: Python Basics
## Overview
This project was completed as part of Codestorm, where I focused on learning the fundamentals of Python programming. The project covered a range of topics, including:

* Data types
* Indexing and slicing
* Operations on data types
* In-built functions and methods
* Statement indentations and conditionals
* Custom functions
* Advanced looping concepts
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Exception handling
* Project Structure
* The project was organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific topic. Here's an overview of the project structure:

**Data Types:** Introduction to different data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

**Indexing and Slicing:** Understanding how to access elements in a sequence using indexing and slicing.

**Operations on Data Types:** Exploring various operations that can be performed on different data types, including arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and more.

**In-built Functions and Methods:** Learning about built-in functions and methods available in Python for performing common tasks.

**Statement Indentations and Conditionals:** Understanding the importance of indentation in Python and working with conditional statements like if, elif, and else.

**Custom Functions:** Writing custom functions to encapsulate reusable pieces of code and improve code modularity.

**Advanced Looping Concepts:** Exploring advanced looping techniques like list comprehensions, nested loops, and iterating over dictionaries.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Introduction to OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

**Exception Handling:** Handling errors and exceptions gracefully using try, except, finally, and raise statements.
